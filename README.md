# PSX Cue Maker

A quick and dirty web-based tool that allows you to drag a collection of PSX `.BIN` files into your browser window and in return, have it generate a `.CUE` file, in case you are missing it.

To find more information and to start generating cue sheets, see `index.html` in your browser.

The page is hosted at https://nielsbuus.dk/pg/psx_cue_maker/

## DuckStation version

The excellent PSX emulator *DuckStation* has adopted the tool and is now hosting it, in an allegedly improved version, at https://www.duckstation.org/cue-maker/
